# Octolendar
*Note*: Current version supports Android API 27 and higher, and that's probably not gonna change for some time.

Octolendar is a calendar application which will allow you to manage your schedule.
At the momement of speaking (02.01.2019) this application has the following features:
-
1) It can calculate the current month's progression and display the information in percentages.
2) While in the process of adding a new event to your schedule, you are able to mark the event with a special tag: "It's Important", "Ugh" or "You can skip it".
3) A *cool* name.

Things left to do are:
-
1) Creating a generator for CardView items, which will contain all information about your planned events.
2) Setting up a simple SQL-database for storing information about your planned events.
3) Adding an activity for managing application settings and a small fragment for displaying the most important upcoming events.
4) An ability to edit and delete existing information.

After completing my to-do list I am planning on cleaning up my code and adding some minor features, such as an optional countdown for some events and etc.
