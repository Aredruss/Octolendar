# Octolendar

Octolendar is a calendar application which will allow you to manage your schedule.
At the momement of speaking (02.01.2019) this application has the following features:
-
1) It can calculate the current month's progression and display the information in percentages;
2) While in the process of adding a new event to your schedule, your are able to mark the event with a special tag: "It's Important", "Ugh" or "You can skip it";
3) A cool name;

Things left to do are:
-
1) Creating a generator for CardView items, which will contain information about planned events;
2) Setting up a simple SQL-database for storing information about planned events;
3) Adding "Settings" activity and "Upcoming events" fragment;

After completing my to-do list I am planning on cleaning up my code and adding some minor features, such as an optional countdown for some events and etc.
